### ðŸ‘‹ Intro

Since school programming has been more to me than just writing code. Thinking about how to solve a given problem is always interesting. Finding an effective algorithm is hard, but rewarding and fun.

Developing frontend for projects is just a perfect job for me. It not only offers unordinary problems but also lets me care about the end user, create nice user-friendly UIs and improve UX

### ðŸ›  Known technologies
React, Redux, HTML, CSS (SCSS), TypeScript, JavaScript, Linters (ESLing, StyleLint)

Node.JS, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), C++

I also have experience with Linux-based operating systems and find them very handy for developers.
