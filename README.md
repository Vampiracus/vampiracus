### ðŸ‘‹ Intro

#### Finding effective algorithms is hard, but fun.

Developing frontend for projects not only offers unordinary problems but also lets one care about the end user, create nice user-friendly and accessible UIs and improve UX. That is why I am into it

### ðŸ›  Tools and languages
- React, Redux, Next.JS
- HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, TypeSctipt
- Vite
- Linters (ESLint, StyleLint, PostCSS)
- Jest, Testplane (a.k.a. Hermione)
- Node.JS
- Nginx
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- C++, Python

I also have experience with Linux-based operating systems and find them very handy for developers.
